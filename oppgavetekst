These are all rather simple tasks. So we expect you to deliver with high quality.
This compulsory activity is delivered in groups. Feel free to create the portfolio page for one of the members of the group or create a fictional persona that represents the group.
Notice that a personal website is not a resume. Resumes are boring. Personal Web sites gives us the opportunity of differentiating ourselves from the rest.

Home page: this is the first page users will see.
You can decide the contents that will be shown to the user in this page.
However, it must contain, at least, the following:o  
Image and description about you (make sure you use proper semantic tags)o  
Text introducing yourselfo  
List of hobbieso  
A quotation from a book, song, or movie

Resume/CV page1: this page presents your academic credentials, skills, and qualifications.
It must contain, at least, the following:  
Academic backgroundo  
Work experienceo  
List of languages you speako  
List of skills

Portfolio page: Use this page to show to the world your best works or projects. A portfolio project can be anything you want to, such as a picture, a drawing, a piece of art, a website, etc. You must include at least 3 different projects. All the projects in your portfolio must have a title, a description explaining what the project is about (5 or 6 lines) and an image.

About page: this page must contain a short report of the preparations you did beforehand to ensure you would use different semantic tags. Explain why you decided to include the different parts of your contents and discuss why the HTML elements you used to annotate them were the best option.
