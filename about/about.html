				<h3>Report</h3>
				<p>
					This webpage is made by Theodor Jaarvik, Ola Gustavsen and Elias Siebke Branæs.
					It is a portfolio for Theodor Jaarvik and his projects.
				</p>
				<p>
					The webpage is made using <b><a href=https:\www.github.com\ola2207\Oblig1>GitHub</a></b>, 
					on and we have all contributed to the page, helped
					each other and gave help and feedback to each other. Even though Theo does
					not like group projects that much, this one went by with few problems.
					Our group has tested and deleted many versions of this webpage. Countless
					backgrounds, fonts and effects were tried before settling on the current design.
				</p>
				<p>
					We decided on a simple and clean look. The design features some color, but not too much to put 
					the projects and text in focus, as well as looking more formal. We used the font Helvetica, as it is 
					easy to read, even on low-resolution displays. We also made an easy to understand menu to make navigating 
					from page to page as accessible as possible. 
					Planning the project was relatively straight forward, as all the website’s requirements were explained 
					in the assignment description. 
				</p>
				<p>
					We used semantic tags to provide additional information about the code, so it was clear what part of the 
					text was what, where it should be placed and what css to use on it. This aided in our communication when 
					coding together, we also gave different parts of the code different id tags to help with this.
					We used for example different header tags (h1,h2, h3), < nav> for the navigation sidebar and < li> to make lists.
					We also made sure to use < hr> to add lines as we found it to be a good way to add structure to the pages.
					Using the header tags (h1,h2, h3) was the best option for our code because it was easy to code, to 
					understand each other, and make sure that it looked the same on every page.
