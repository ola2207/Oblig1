				<p>
					This webpage is made by Theodor Jaarvik, Ola Gustavsen and Elias Siebke
					Bran√¶s. It is a portofoilio for Theodor Jaarvik and his projects. The
					webpage is made using github, and we have all contributed to the page,
					helped eachother and given help and feedback to each other. Even though
					Theo does not like group projects that much, this one went by with few
					problems. Our group have tested and deleted many versions of this webpage.
					Countless backgrounds, fonts and effects were tried before settling on the
					currnet design. We decided on a simple and clean look. The design features
					some color, but not too much to put the projects and text in focus, as well
					as looking more formal. We used the font Helvetica, as it is easy to read,
					even on low-resolution displays. We also made an easy to understand menu to
					make navigating from page to page as accessible as possible. Planning the
					project was relatively straight forward, as all the.
