			<h3>Report</h3>
			<p>
				This webpage is made by Theodor Jaarvik, Ola Gustavsen and Elias Siebke
				Branæs. It is a portfolio for Theodor Jaarvik and his projects.
			</p>
			<p>
				The webpage is made using GitHub, and we have all contributed to the page,
				helped each other and given help and feedback to each other. Even though
				Theo does not like group projects that much, this one went by with few
				problems. Our group has tested and deleted many versions of this webpage.
				Countless backgrounds, fonts and effects were tried before settling on the
				current design.
			</p>
			<p>
				We decided on a simple and clean look. The design features some color, but
				not too much. This is to put the projects and text in focus, as well as
				looking more formal. We used the font Helvetica, as it is easy to read, even
				on low-resolution displays. We also made an easy to understand menu to make
				navigating from page to page as accessible as possible. Planning the project
				was relatively straight forward, as all the website’s requirements were
				explained in the assignment description.
			</p>
			<p>
				We used semantic tags to provide additional information about the code, so
				it was clear what part of the text was what, where it should be placed and
				what css to use on it. This aided in our communication when coding together,
				we also gave different parts of the code different div ids to help with
				this. We used for example different header tags (h1,h2, h3),
				<code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> for the navigation sidebar and
				<code>&lt;li&gt;</code> to make lists. We also made sure to use
				<code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> to add lines as we found it to be a good way to add
				structure to the pages. Using the header tags (h1,h2, h3) was the best
				option for our code because it was easy to code, to understand each other,
				and make sure that it looked the same on every page.
