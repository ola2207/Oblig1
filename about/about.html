				<p>
					This webpage is made by Theodor Jaarvik, Ola Gustavsen and Elias Siebke
					Bran√¶s. It is a portofoilio for Theodor Jaarvik and his projects. The
					webpage is made using github, and we have all contributed to the page,
					helped eachother and gotten help and feedback from our classmates. Even
					though Theo does not like group projects that much, this one went by with
					few problems. Our group have tested and deleted many versions of this
					webpage. Countless backgrounds, fonts and effects were tried before getting
					to the glorius project we can see now.

					Preparations you did beforehand to ensure you would use different semantic
					tags: Explain why you decided to include the different parts of your
					contents and discuss why the HTML elements you used to annotate them were
					the best option: We decided on a simple clean look, with some color, but
					not too much to put the projects and text in focus. We used the font
					Helvetica, as it is easy to read even in small formats. We also made an
					easy to understand menu to make navigating from page to page easy.
